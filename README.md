# AgroVision
Project for NASA hackaton

We developed AgroVision, a platform that delivers real-time environmental insights to farmers using NASAâ€™s SMAP satellite data. Integrated with a Telegram bot, the system allows users to input their location and receive visualizations of local soil moisture and temperature conditions, helping them make informed decisions on irrigation and crop management.

AgroVision simplifies access to satellite data, empowering farmers with actionable insights to improve crop planning, optimize resources, and enhance productivity, especially in areas with limited traditional data sources.
