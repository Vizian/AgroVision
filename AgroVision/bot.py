            "- **Crops**: No crops can survive at this moisture level without irrigation.\n"
            "- **Action**: Immediate, heavy irrigation is required to improve soil conditions. Consider emergency measures to prevent further crop losses.\n\n"
    
            "ðŸŸ  **0.1 to 0.2 (Dry)**:\n"
            "- **Description**: The soil is very dry, and most crops will be under significant water stress. Shallow-rooted crops will suffer.\n"
            "- **Crops**: Drought-tolerant crops like millet, sorghum, and some types of beans may survive, but growth will be limited.\n"
            "- **Action**: Irrigation is strongly recommended. Light to moderate watering can help maintain crop health, but frequent irrigation may be required.\n\n"
    
            "ðŸŸ¡ **0.2 to 0.3 (Moderately dry)**:\n"
            "- **Description**: The soil has limited moisture, which may cause stress in many crops, especially during hot weather.\n"
            "- **Crops**: Drought-tolerant crops such as corn, barley, and wheat can survive, but yields may be lower without irrigation.\n"
            "- **Action**: Moderate irrigation is recommended to avoid yield losses. Monitor moisture levels closely, especially during key growth stages.\n\n"
    
            "ðŸŸ¢ **0.3 to 0.4 (Good for crops)**:\n"
            "- **Description**: The soil has adequate moisture for most crops. Plant roots can easily access water, and growth should be normal.\n"
            "- **Crops**: Suitable for many common crops like wheat, soybeans, corn, and potatoes.\n"
            "- **Action**: No immediate irrigation is needed, but regular monitoring is important to ensure moisture levels stay consistent. Consider irrigation only during dry spells.\n\n"
    
            "ðŸŸ¢ **0.4 to 0.5 (Well-moistened)**:\n"
            "- **Description**: The soil moisture level is excellent for most crops. Water is readily available to plants, promoting strong growth.\n"
            "- **Crops**: Ideal for a wide range of crops, including rice, vegetables like tomatoes and peppers, and fruit trees like apples.\n"

            "ðŸ”µ **Above 0.6 (Waterlogged)**:\n"
            "- **Description**: The soil is saturated with water, which can lead to root suffocation and disease. This condition is not suitable for most crops.\n"
            "- **Crops**: Very few crops can tolerate these conditions. Rice may survive in flooded conditions, but most crops will struggle or die.\n"
